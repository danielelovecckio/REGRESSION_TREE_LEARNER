# REGRESSION_TREE_LEARNER
A project made for a University course, there is an implementation of a Regression Tree Learner built up using java.
This simple model has been trained using a simple dataset composed by discrete attributes and continuous attributes. 
In addition to the construction of the probabilistic model, a small client-server system has been designed, where the client has the possibility of asking the server to predict values 
according to the inputs it provides.
There is also an implementation of the client interface, using JavaFX.
